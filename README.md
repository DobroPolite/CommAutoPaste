# Comment injector from xlsx doc
Hello! This code was created to automate comments writing on site, an analogue of YouTube.

Below is the indicated position, on the use of this miracle of engineering.

**Instruction**:

1. The working program or code can be installed by browsing this repository on your computer. [Cloning instructions]( https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository).
2. In the project folder, upload the account.txt file and the .xlsx file with comments, everything should look something like this:

3. After the preliminary procedures, you can run the file itself. The file will meet three inputs in turn: **file name with comments, video URL and number of comments**.

In the field with **file name**, enter ONLY the name, without the file format. The file must be in the .xlsx format, otherwise the program will not work and will issue the following *exception*:

You also need to enter the correct name to avoid another *exception*:

The **URL** field requires a set of rules to send to the video, or the following *exception* will be generated:

In the field with **number of comments**, you must enter the number of comments as a whole number, as you might guess.
4. After that, wait until the program closes itself. The end, the result on the site.
